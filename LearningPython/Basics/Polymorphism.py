What is Polymorphism?
Sometimes object comes in many types or forms.
if we have a button, there are many different draw outputs(round button, check button, square button, button
with image) but they do share the same logic:onclick().
we access them using the same method. this idea is called polymorphism.
Polymorphism in python can be achieved by using overloading and overriding methods.
"""
"""
Method Overriding:
Override means two methods having same name but doing different tasks.
It means that one of the methods overrides the other.
If there is any method in the superclass and  a method with a same name in a subclasss,
then by executing the method, the method of the corresponding class will be executed

"""
class Parent:
    name="scott"
class Child(Parent):
    nmae="David"
obj=Child()
print(obj.nmae)#Since variable name is same, hence the child class variable overrides the parent cls variable

"""
Ex3:Method Overloading:
In python you can define a method in such a way that there are multiple ways to call it.
Given a single method or function, we can specify the number of parameters our self
